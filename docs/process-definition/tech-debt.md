# Tech Debt Flow

> This is a work in progress (WIP) flow. See [the board] for the latest status.

We are addressing our Tech Debt through a series of meetings for priority and organization. This is our first step in managing our backlog in a way that the developer team can participate.

This effort is driven by the [Advisors].
