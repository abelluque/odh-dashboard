# Process Flows Defined

> Note: Process flows revolve around the [ODH Dashboard Planning] board's statuses.

These flows are around our process for how to manage our tickets and keep things consistent and aligned. Allowing for multiple individuals and teams to collaborate effectively without a lot of slowdown for conversations on "what do I do here?" - If the process has gaps, we will improve it as they are identified.

## Issue Templates

The issue [templates] we use have a flow or a use-case behind it. To help sync the discussion on process with these templates, see below how that mapping works.

Users, designers, and developers of the Dashboard will often find themselves interacting with the first two non-internal flows to help identify bugs & to request new features:

- "Bug Report" is used in the [Standard Issue Flow]
- "Feature Request" is used in the [Standard Issue Flow]

Whereas the other templates are used in internal flows:

> **What is an internal template?**<br />
> It is just a template structure we built to help unify the organization of common flows. They can be created by anyone, but usually has mixed results if not participating in said flows.

- "(Internal) Feature Story Template" is used in the [Story Flow]
- "(Internal) Tech Debt Template" use-case is described in [Tech Debt]
- "(Internal) Test Template" use-case is described in [Tech Debt]
- "(Internal) Tracker Template" is used in the [Feature Flow]
- "(Internal) UX Template" is used in the [UX Flow]
