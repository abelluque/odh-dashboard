# Dashboard Advisors

Those considered "Advisors" of the Dashboard are also [OWNERS] file `approvers`.

These are the major responsibilities fall upon the Advisors.

1. They are the `approvers` of all PRs that go into the Dashboard - no code change can be done without an Advisor approval
2. They help direct the path of the Dashboard code... they are intended to answer questions like this:
   - Do we want a community logged feature; does it add the value / user flows we want to showcase? (UX will be consulted as needed)
   - Is a feature ready to merge into `main`? (see [incubation] for more details)
3. They strive to align the team on the same [core flows]
4. Bring stability to our API; CRD definition & internal [endpoints]
